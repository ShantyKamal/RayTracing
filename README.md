# RayTracing
Implementation of a basic ray tracing system to simulate the optics of a pinhole camera. Shading models that approximate ambient, diffuse, and specular light reflection on surfaces are explored to give objects in the scene the appearance of having different materials. 


Geometric vector data types and associated operations from The OpenGL Mathematics library (GLM) were used but not included in the above files. You will need to download and include it in your middleware folder.
